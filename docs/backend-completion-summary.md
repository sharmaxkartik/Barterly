## 🛠️ Issues Resolved

### 1. Firestore Security Rules ✅

- **Problem:** Overly restrictive rules blocking API access
- **Solution:** Updated rules with proper scoped permissions
- **Status:** Deployed successfully to Firebase

### 2. Database Indexes ✅

- **Problem:** Missing composite indexes for complex queries
- **Solution:** Created indexes for reviews queries with orderBy
- **Status:** Deployed to Firebase, will enable orderBy once indexes build

### 3. Environment Configuration ✅

- **Problem:** Missing NextAuth and Firebase credentials
- **Solution:** Added all required environment variables to `.env.local`
- **Status:** Configured and working

### 4. API Error Handling ✅

- **Problem:** Generic error responses without debugging info
- **Solution:** Added comprehensive error logging across endpoints
- **Status:** Implemented with console.error for debugging
